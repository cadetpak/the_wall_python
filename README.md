# the_wall_python
"The Wall" assignment from Coding Dojo - Python stack 

1. User can register, with validations. 
2. User can login, with validations. 
3. User is added to MySQL database. 
4. User can post messages. 
5. User can posts comments to each message. 
6. Dashboard shows every message (each message with their time stamp of creation, and name of user who posted the message). 
7. Every message with comments shows each comment (with time stamp of creation, and name of user who posted the comment). 
8. User can log out. 

// I was not able to add delete post function cleanly.  Even if user did not post an initial message, the page would automatically load a false message. 
This message did not exist in database, and would 'disappear' once the user posted a real message.  But once that message was deleted, the 'false' message showed again. 
// The first time I did this assignment, it took me over 8 hours.  -- Today, I was able to do it in 2 hours! :)
